# Sydney Java Meet-Up 19 - Java and Image Rekognition
For this month's Java Meetup we're delving into computer vision!
Luke Quinane will be showing us how to use AWS Rekognition to investigate unstructured data.
Luke Thompson will demo using OpenCV and Java to perform image manipulation with a serverless API.

### Program
6pm - Networking/Drinks/Food  

6:30pm - Event Intro and Job Shouts  

6:35pm - AWS Rekognition  
How AWS Rekognition can aid investigations into unstructured data. Digging into how pre-packaged AI APIs can help solve customer problems with large volumes of data.
